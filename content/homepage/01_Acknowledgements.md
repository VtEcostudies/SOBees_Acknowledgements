The State of Bees report represents countless hours of work from hundreds of people. Each of the nearly 60,000 bee records that form the backbone of this report are by themselves a collaboration of many individuals and organizations. Each record starts with either a photograph or specimen collected in the field, often by a volunteer or scientist working on their own project. Each record is identified by at least one expert taxonomist, who is basing their work on more than a century of prior taxonomic work. Finally, each record is digitized,shared as open data with the Vermont Atlas of Life and GBIF.
